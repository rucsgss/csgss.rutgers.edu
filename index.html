			<h2>Welcome Back</h2>
			<p>
				We'd like to welcome everyone back to Rutgers for another exciting year in
				CS.&nbsp;
				This is the Computer Science Graduate Student Society (CSGSS) website, which should be going through a big redesign in the next few weeks.
				We'll be having social events throughout the semester where you can meet
				other students as well as some of the faculty members.
