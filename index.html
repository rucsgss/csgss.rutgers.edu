        <h3>CSGSS Elections for 2012-2013</h3>
        <p>
          If you would like to be a CSGSS officer next year, or if you
          know somebody who would be interested,
          please <a href="mailto:babes@cs.rutgers.edu">let me
          know</a>!  The previous officers will be happy to come
          alongside the new ones and help. It's a really good
          experience and you can really make a difference for the CS
          grad students. We will be voting during our next social, on
          April 4th.
