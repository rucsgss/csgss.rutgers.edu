          <h1>The Survival Guide</h1>
          <p>The Survival Guide was originally an annual publication by CSGSS. It has not been updated in some time now (at least 5 years), and we have replaced it with this wiki. Thanks to the Collections plugin for MediaWiki, we are able to create a printed guide. If you are interested in helping out with the Survival Guide, please contact the current CSGSS president.</p>


          <h1>Department History</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/">Division of Computer and Information Sciences</a> in New Brunswick was established at Rutgers in 1969 as the Computer Science Department. Programs leading to a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science are offered by the undergraduate colleges at Rutgers. The faculty of the division are members of the <a href="http://sas.rutgers.edu/">School of Arts and Sciences</a> (SAS). The Graduate Program in Computer Science, which is a program in the Graduate School, offers courses of study leading to an M.S. or a Ph.D. in computer science. (The Master of Philosophy degree is available to doctoral candidates who have fulfilled certain requirements except for completing a dissertation.)</p>
<p>In 2001 the university decided to upgrade the status of Computer Science to the Division of Computer and Information Sciences within SAS. This follows the model of the Division of Life Sciences which was created earlier. The Division includes the Department of Computer Science and several research centers. DCIS will eventually be led by the Area Dean just like the other 5 divisions within the SAS. The formation of the Division reflects the high priority that computer sciences enjoy within the SAS. The Division intends to grow to 60 faculty and several strong, externally funded research centers in new exciting areas.</p>
