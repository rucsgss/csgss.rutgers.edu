          <h1>The Survival Guide</h1>
          <p>The Survival Guide was originally an annual publication by CSGSS. It has not been updated in some time now (at least 5 years), and we have replaced it with this wiki. Thanks to the Collections plugin for MediaWiki, we are able to create a printed guide. If you are interested in helping out with the Survival Guide, please contact the current CSGSS president.</p>
