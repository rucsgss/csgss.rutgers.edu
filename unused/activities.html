        <h1>Graduate Student Hosts</h1>
        <p>In the past, CSGSS has sought current graduate students to act as student hosts for incoming students. The goal was to help new students, especially those arriving from foreign countries, become accustomed to the CS department, Rutgers University, and the surrounding area. If you are interested in becoming a student host, please contact a current CSGSS executive officer.</p>

        <h1>DCS Graduate Student Lounge (Hill 350)</h1>
        <p>CSGSS is presently working with the department to improve the GSL. Previously, the GSL had become more of a work space/mail room, and the intention of our undertaking is to transform it into a space where graduate students can go to relax, watch a movie, or sit and talk with friends. After remodeling, the mailboxes will remain.</p>
