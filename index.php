              <h3>Fri., Nov. 1, 2013</h3>
              <p>Shubhangi's research interests lie in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. Her research draws on tools from mathematics such as probability theory, algebra and discrete geometry to better understand some of the basic questions in theoretical computer science in areas such as the complexity of arithmetic computation, randomness in computing, property testing and coding theory.</p>

              <p>Shauna Gordon-McKeon from <a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch.org</a> will be helping students get acquainted with and learn about open source:</p>
              <p>"We'll teach you about open source licensing, collaboration tools, and how free software projects are organized. Then we'll help you make contributions to open source projects. And throughout, we'll feed you, get to know you, and talk with you about opportunities for students in open source."</p>
