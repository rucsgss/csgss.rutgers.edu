        <h1>About CSGSS</h1>
        <p>The Computer Science Graduate Student Society (CSGSS) is an organization of graduate students whose goals are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>improving the quality of the graduate academic department;</li>
          <li>supporting and improving communications among graduate students and between graduate students and faculty; and</li>
          <li>improving the social and cultural life of the Computer Science graduate students.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We strongly encourage your active participation in CSGSS. If you have suggestions on how to improve any aspect of graduate student life, please bring it to the attention of an <a href="../officers/">executive officer</a> of CSGSS or the appropriate committee representative. If you are unsure who to contact, or have a request of interest to the executive board, send mail to the current president.</p>
        <p>CSGSS is part of the all-encompassing <a href="http://gsa.rutgers.edu/">Graduate Student Association (GSA)</a>. The GSA is the official forum for graduate students to voice comments, concerns, and complaints about graduate life at Rutgers University. All of our yearly funding comes from the GSA, though the department often contributes to individual projects and events undertaken by CSGSS.</p>
